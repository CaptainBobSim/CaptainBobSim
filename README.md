## About Me
Hi there! My name is Trevor Olsen, I'm a student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at Colorado State University. I am passionate about flight simulators and creating life-like hardware replicas of popular aircraft.

If you love looking at Electrical and Mechanical Engineering (and who doesn't!) you might enjoy taking a stroll down my [portfolio](https://captainbobsim.com/portfolio/).

I'm proficient in Fusion 360, SolidWorks, MATLAB, EasyEDA, DaVinci Resolve, Inkscape, MobiFlight, Lua Scripting (interacting with Flight Sim), Python, and G-Code. I have a variety of projects anywhere from school, professional, or personal. You can contact me at CaptainBobSim@gmail.com

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a life-size, fully functional [Cessna 172 Simulator Setup](https://github.com/CaptainBobSim/The-Cessna-172-Project-V3)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Mechanical Engineering at Colorado State University
- âš¡ Fun fact: There are 140 miles of wiring inside a Boeing 747. That's like walking 140 miles once, or one mile 140 times!
