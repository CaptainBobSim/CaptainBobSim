## About Me
Hi there! My name is Trevor Olsen, I'm a student pursuing a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering at Colorado State University. I am passionate about flight simulators and create life-like replicas of popular aircraft.

I'm proficient in MATLAB, Fusion 360, DaVinci Resolve, Inkscape, MobiFlight, Lua Scripting (Flight Simulator Primarily), and G-Code. I have a variety of projects ranging from school to personal. You can contact me at CaptainBobSim@gmail.com

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a life size, fully functional Cessna 172 Simulator
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Mechanical Engineering at Colorado State University
- âš¡ Fun fact: There are 140 miles of wiring inside a Boeing 747. That's like walking 140 miles once!
